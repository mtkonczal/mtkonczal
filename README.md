- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mtkonczal
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my website or twitter.

Here I'll be collecting and sharing scripts I use for economic analysis, generally in R, both on projects and for regularly reported economic indicators. There's a special focus on the data printed monthly by the BLS, especially for creating and sharing graphics that help explain the recovery from the covid pademic. Feel free to share your favorites!
